**Abstract**: The secure transmission of confidential information in cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) communication networks is vitally important for user's personal safety. However, for C-V2X, there have not been many studies on the physical layer security (PLS). Since artificial noise (AN) and secure beamforming are popular PLS techniques for cellular communications, in this paper we investigate the potential of these PLS techniques for enhancing the security of C-V2X networks. In particular, leveraging stochastic geometry, we study the PLS of an AN assisted C-V2X network, where the locations of legitimate vehicular nodes, malicious vehicular nodes and road side units (RSUs) are modeled by Cox processes driven by a common Poisson line process (PLP), and the locations of cellular base stations (BSs) are modeled by a two-dimensional (2D) Poisson point process (PPP). Based on the maximum signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) association scheme, we calculate the coverage probability of the network. We also derive bounds on the secrecy probability, which are validated by simulation results. Moreover, we obtain an analytical result of the effective secrecy throughput for characterizing the reliability and security of wiretap channels. Simulation results are given to validate the analytical result, and provide interesting insights into the impact of network parameters on the achievable secrecy performance. Simulation results show that a larger array antenna can provide a better robustness of the secure transmission strategy, and the optimal power allocation ratio between confidential information and AN remains almost unchanged for different numbers of antennas.
