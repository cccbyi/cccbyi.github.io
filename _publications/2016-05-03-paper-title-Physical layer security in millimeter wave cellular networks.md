excerpt: "<img src='/images/0503.png' style='float: right; margin: 5px;'>This paper investigates the physical layer security of millimeter wave (mmWave) cellular networks using stochastic geometry. It analyzes the secure connectivity probability and average number of perfect communication links per unit area for both noise-limited and interference-limited scenarios, considering non-colluding and colluding eavesdroppers. The study shows the importance of antenna array patterns and eavesdropper intensity in determining the secrecy performance and provides insights into optimal power allocation for artificial noise in mmWave networks."

**Abstract**: Recent studies show that millimeter wave (mmWave) communications can offer orders of magnitude, which increases in the cellular capacity. However, the secrecy performance of an mmWave cellular network has not been investigated so far. Leveraging the new path-loss and blockage models for mmWave channels, which are significantly different from the conventional microwave channel, this paper comprehensively studies the network-wide physical layer security performance of the downlink transmission in an mmWave cellular network under a stochastic geometry framework. We first study the secure connectivity probability and the average number of perfect communication links per unit area in a noise-limited mmWave network for both non-colluding and colluding eavesdroppers scenarios, respectively. Then, we evaluate the effect of the artificial noise (AN) on the secrecy performance, and derive the analysis result of average number of perfect communication links per unit area in an interference-limited mmWave network. Numerical results demonstrate the network-wide secrecy performance, and provide interesting insights into how the secrecy performance is influenced by various network parameters: antenna array pattern, base station intensity, and AN power allocation.
