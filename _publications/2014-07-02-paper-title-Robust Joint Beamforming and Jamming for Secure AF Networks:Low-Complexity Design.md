**Abstract**: This paper investigates the physical-layer security issue of an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay network. We propose a joint cooperative beamforming (CB) and cooperative jamming (CJ) design that is robust to the imperfect channel state information (CSI) of the multiple multiantenna eavesdroppers. The objective is the worst-case secrecy rate maximization (WCSRM). Based on the inner convex approximation and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique, the original nonconvex problem is transformed into a sequence of approximate convex problems, which can be solved conveniently. The proposed robust design guarantees to converge to a Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) solution and is efficient in computational complexity. Furthermore, we prove that SDR always has a rank-1 solution, which identifies that SDR is tight. Simulations demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy.


**Index Terms**: Cooperative beamforming (CB), inner convex approxi mation (ICA), jamming, secrecy rate, semidefinite relaxation (SDR).
