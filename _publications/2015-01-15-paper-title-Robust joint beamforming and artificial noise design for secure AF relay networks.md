**Abstract**: This letter studies the secure cooperative transmission for an amplify-and-forward (AF) relay network in the presence of multiple multi-antenna eavesdroppers. Since the perfect channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdroppers are not available, we propose a robust joint distributed beamforming and artificial noise scheme to maximize the worst-case secrecy rate of the network, under the total power constraint of all the relay nodes. With the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique, the design can be solved by a one-dimension search which involves a sequence of semidefinite programming (SDP). Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed strategy.
