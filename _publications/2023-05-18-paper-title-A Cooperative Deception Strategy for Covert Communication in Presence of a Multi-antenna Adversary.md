**Abstract**: Covert transmission is investigated for a cooperative deception strategy, where a cooperative jammer (Jammer) tries to attract a multi-antenna adversary (Willie) and degrade the adversary’s reception ability for the signal from a transmitter (Alice). For this strategy, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the covert rate when three different types of channel state information (CSI) are available. The total power is optimally allocated between Alice and Jammer subject to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence constraint, which can be expressed analytically and be widely used as a covertness measurement. Different from the existing literature, in our proposed strategy, we also determine the optimal transmission power at the jammer when Alice is silent, while existing works always assume that the jammer’s power is fixed. Specifically, we apply the S-procedure to convert infinite constraints into linear-matrix-inequalities (LMI) constraints. When statistical CSI at Willie is available, we convert double integration to single integration using asymptotic approximation and substitution method. Finally, our simulation results show that for the proposed strategy, the covert rate is increased with the number of antennas at Willie. Moreover, compared to the benchmark, our proposed strategy is more robust in the presence of imperfect CSI.
