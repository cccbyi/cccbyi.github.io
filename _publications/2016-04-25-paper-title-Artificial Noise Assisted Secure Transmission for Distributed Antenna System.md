**Abstract**: This paper studies the artificial noise (AN) assisted secure transmission for a distributed antenna systems (DAS). To avoid a significant overhead caused by full legitimate channel state information (CSI) acquisition, tracking and collection in the central processor, we propose a distributed AN scheme utilizing the large-scale CSI of the legitimate receiver and eavesdropper. Our objective is to maximize the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) via optimizing the power allocation between the confidential signal and AN for each remote antenna (RA) under the per-antenna power constraint. Specifically, exploiting random matrix theory, we first establish an analytical expression of the achievable ESR, which leads to a non-convex optimization problem with multiple non-convex constraints in the form of high-order fixed-point equations. To handle the intractable constraints, we recast it into a max-min optimization problem, and propose an iterative block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to provide a stationary solution. The BCD algorithm is composed of three subproblems, where the first two subproblems are convex with closed-form solutions, and the last one is a convex-concave game whose saddle-point is located by a tailored barrier algorithm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed iterative algorithm and show that our scheme not only reduces the system overhead greatly but also maintains a good secrecy performance.
