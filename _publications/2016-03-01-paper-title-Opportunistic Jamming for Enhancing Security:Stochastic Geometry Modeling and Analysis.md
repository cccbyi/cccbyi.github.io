excerpt: "<img src='/images/0301.png' style='float: right; margin: 5px;'>We proposes an opportunistic jammer selection scheme for enhancing security in a single-input–single-output multieavesdropper (SISOME) channel using stochastic geometry modeling and analysis. The scheme selects jammers based on their channel gains to the legitimate receiver, allowing them to transmit independent Gaussian jamming signals to confuse eavesdroppers. The authors derive the secrecy throughput and prove it is a quasi-concave function of the selection threshold, enabling efficient optimization. Simulation results demonstrate significant improvements in secrecy performance compared to random jammer selection schemes."

**Abstract**: This paper studies the secrecy communication of the single-input-single-output multieavesdropper (SISOME) channel with multiple single-antenna jammers, where the jammers and the eavesdroppers are distributed according to the independent 2-D homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP). For enhancing the physical layer security, we propose an opportunistic multiple-jammer selection scheme, where the jammers whose channel gains to the legitimate receiver are less than a threshold are selected to transmit independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian jamming signals to confound the eavesdroppers. We characterize the secrecy throughput achieved by our proposed jammer selection scheme and show that the secrecy throughput is a quasi-concave function of the selection threshold.
