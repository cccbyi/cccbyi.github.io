**Abstract**: Considering a simultaneously transmitting and re f lecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RIS)-aided dual-functional radar-communications (DFRC) system, this pa per proposes a symbol-level precoding-based scheme for enhanc ing the physical layer (PHY) security of the confidential informa tion transmission and performing target sensing simultaneously. Specifically, the STAR-RIS-aided DFRC system design objective is to maximize the average received radar sensing power subject to the quality-of-service constraints for multiple communication users, the security constraint for multiple potential eavesdrop pers, as well as various practical waveform design restrictions. However, the formulated problem is challenging to handle due to its nonconvexity. To address these issues, we propose a distance majorization induced low-complexity algorithm to obtain an efficient solution. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the STAR-RIS in improving the DFRC performance.
**Index Terms**: STAR-RIS, dual-functional radar communication, symbol-level precoding, distance-majorization.
