excerpt: "The paper proposes an opportunistic jammer selection scheme for the SIMOME wiretap channel. It selects single-antenna jammers to transmit Gaussian jamming signals to confuse eavesdroppers without centralized coordination. The scheme optimizes the selection threshold to maximize secrecy throughput and ergodic secrecy rate, achieving significant performance gains over random jammer selection."

**Abstract**: This paper studies a single-input multi-output multi-eavesdropper (SIMOME) wiretap channel with multiple friendly single-antenna jammers. We consider random networks where the jammers and the eavesdroppers are distributed according to independent two-dimensional homogeneous Poisson point processes (PPP). We propose an opportunistic jammer selection scheme for the physical layer security enhancement, where the jammers whose channels are nearly orthogonal to the channel direction information (CDI) of the legitimate channel are selected to transmit independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian jamming signals to confound the eavesdroppers. The proposed scheme does not require a centralized design and signal coordinations among multiple jammers are not needed anymore. Furthermore, we analyze both the achievable secrecy throughput and the ergodic secrecy rate of the proposed jammer selection scheme. Based on the analysis results, we optimize the selection threshold for the secrecy throughput maximization and ergodic secrecy rate maximization. Simulation results show that the proposed jammer selection scheme can achieve a substantial performance gain.
**Index Terms**: SIMOME wiretap channel, opportunistic jam mers selection, secrecy throughput, ergodic secrecy rate.
