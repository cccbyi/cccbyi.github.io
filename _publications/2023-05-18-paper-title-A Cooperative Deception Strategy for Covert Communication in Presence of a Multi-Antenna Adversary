excerpt: "We proposes a symbol-level precoding-based scheme for STAR-RIS-aided dual-functional radar-communications (DFRC) systems. The aim is to securely transmit confidential information and perform target sensing concurrently. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the average received radar sensing power, subject to constraints on communication users' quality-of-service and security, as well as practical waveform design restrictions."

**Abstract**: Covert transmission is investigated for a cooperative deception strategy, where a cooperative jammer
 (Jammer) tries to attract a multi-antenna adversary (Willie) and degrade the adversary’s reception ability
 for the signal from a transmitter (Alice). For this strategy, we formulate an optimization problem to
 maximize the covert rate when three different types of channel state information (CSI) are available.
 The total power is optimally allocated between Alice and Jammer subject to Kullback-Leibler (KL)
 divergence constraint. Different from the existing literature, in our proposed strategy, we also determine
 the optimal transmission power at the jammer when Alice is silent, while existing works always assume
 that the jammer’s power is fixed. Specifically, we apply the S-procedure to convert infinite constraints
 into linear-matrix-inequalities (LMI) constraints. When statistical CSI at Willie is available, we convert
 double integration to single integration using asymptotic approximation and substitution method. In
 addition, the transmission strategy without jammer deception is studied as a benchmark. Finally, our
 simulation results show that for the proposed strategy, the covert rate is increased with the number of
 antennas at Willie. Moreover, compared to the benchmark, our proposed strategy is more robust in face
 of imperfect CSI.
