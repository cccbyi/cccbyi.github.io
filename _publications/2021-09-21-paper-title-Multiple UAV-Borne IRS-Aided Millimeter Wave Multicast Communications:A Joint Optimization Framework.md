**Abstract**: In this letter, we design a resource allocation algo rithm for commmunications in millimeter wave (mmWave) mul ticast systems adopting multiple unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) borne intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs). Considering the effect of blockages of building, we jointly optimize the placement of UAVs and the beamforming at the ground base station (BS) and the passive beamforming at the IRSs for maximizing the minimum rate of multiple user clusters. For handling the non convex optimization problem, we first employ the simulated an nealing (SA)-based hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO) algorithm to design the deployment of UAVs for maximizing the average minimum achievable rate. Then, we propose a penalty based block coordinated descent (BCD) algorithm to design the active and passive beamforming for maximizing the instantaneous minimum rate. Simulation results validate the efficiency of our proposed joint optimization framework.
