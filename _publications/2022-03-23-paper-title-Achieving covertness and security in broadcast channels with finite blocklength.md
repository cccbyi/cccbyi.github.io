excerpt: "<img src='/images/0323.jpg' style='float: right; margin: 5px;'>We proposes a symbol-level precoding-based scheme for STAR-RIS-aided dual-functional radar-communications (DFRC) systems. The aim is to securely transmit confidential information and perform target sensing concurrently. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the average received radar sensing power, subject to constraints on communication users' quality-of-service and security, as well as practical waveform design restrictions."

**Abstract**: Considering multi-user downlink ultra-high relia
bility and low latency communications (URLLC), this paper
 employs the artificial noise (AN) technique to establish a secure
 and covert broadcast communication paradigm for the first
 time. Specifically, a multi-antenna transmitter (Alice) broadcasts
 the confidential information to multiple legitimate users in the
 presence of a multi-antenna malicious warden (Willie) and a
 multi-antenna eavesdropper (Eve). It is well known that AN
 is an effective technique for securing the physical layer secu
rity (PLS) of signal transmissions. Nevertheless, AN emission also exposes the signal transmission and decreases the signal
 covertness. Taking into account the impact of short-packet
 URLLC transmissions, we investigate the joint optimization
 of the precoder and AN to maximize the secrecy rate under
 the covertness constraint. Although the considered problem is
 nonconvex, we propose a branch-reduce-and-bound (BRB)-based
 algorithm to solve it optimally. However, the nested-loop struc
ture of the BRB-based algorithm incurs a high computational
 complexity. To strike a balance between the performance and
 computational complexity, we also propose a low-complexity
 penalty successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm,
 whose performance approaches that of the optimal BRB-based
 algorithm, particularly in the low to medium transmit power
 regime. Simulation results demonstrate the excellent performance
 of our proposed optimization algorithms compared with various
 benchmark algorithms and unveil the importance of exploiting
 AN for secrecy provisioning.
