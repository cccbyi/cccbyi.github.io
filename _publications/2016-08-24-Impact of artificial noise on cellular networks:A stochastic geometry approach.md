**Abstract**: This paper studies the impact of artificial noise (AN) on the secrecy performance of a target cell in multi-cell cellular networks. Although AN turns out to be an efficient approach for securing a point-to-point/single-cell confidential transmission, it would increase the inter-cell interference in a multi-cell cellular network, which may degrade the network reliability and secrecy performance. For analyzing the average secrecy performance of the target cell which is of significant interest, we employ a hybrid cellular deployment model, where the target cell is a circle of fixed size, and the base stations outside the target cell are modeled as a homogeneous Poisson point process. We investigate the impact of AN on the reliability and security of users in the target cell in the presence of pilot contamination using a stochastic geometry approach. The analytical results of the average connection outage and the secrecy outage of its cellular user (CU) in the target cell are given, which facilitates the evaluation of the average secrecy throughput of a randomly chosen CU in the target cell. It shows that with an optimized power allocation between the desired signals and AN, the AN scheme is an efficient solution for securing the communications in a multi-cell cellular network.
