**Abstract**: This paper investigates secure broadcast communications in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided millimeter wave (mmWave) symbiotic radio (SR) networks, where the IRS and the base station (BS) are cooperating. Specifically, the IRS assists secure broadcasting for the BS by smartly reconfiguring the phase shifts of the signals from the BS, while delivering its own information to an Internet-of-Things device (IoD). We aim at maximizing the minimum secrecy rate of multiple users by jointly designing the hybrid precoder at the BS and the passive beamformer at the IRS, subject to the rate constraints of both the multiple users and the IoD. The design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem, which is intractable. To handle it, we develop a computationally efficient iterative algorithm based on the successive convex approximation, the efficiency and superiority of which have been validated by simulation results.
