**Abstract**: Hybrid precoding architecture, as a cost-effective approach for millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications, can achieve an excellent tradeoff between spectrum efficiency and hardware implementation complexity. However, the design of a robust hybrid precoding for improving the physical layer security (PLS), which is insensitive to the uncertainty of eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI), has not been well studied. This article for the first time designs a probabilistically robust hybrid precoding scheme for securing broadcast communications in Internet of Things (IoT) with eavesdropper's imperfect CSI. Specifically, considering the Gaussian CSI error model, we maximize the minimum secrecy rate of multiple IoT devices (IoDs) by jointly designing analog and digital precoders under the constraints in terms of secrecy outage probability and per IoD's information rate. The optimization problem is challenging due to the coupling of the analog and digital precoders, and the secrecy outage constraint. To handle these challenges, we first employ a conservative probability inequality to transform the secrecy outage probability constraint into a deterministic one. Then, by employing the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) method, we develop a novel iterative algorithm to convert the resultant nonconvex problem into a sequence of convex problems, which can guarantee the convergence to its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve significant secrecy performance gains compared with the benchmark algorithm.
