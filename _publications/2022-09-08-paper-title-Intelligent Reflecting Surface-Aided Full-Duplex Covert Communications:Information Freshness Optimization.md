**Abstract**：This work investigates the covert information fresh ness in intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided communications, where a public full-duplex user (Alice) and a private full-duplex user (Bob) exchange information in the presence of a watchful warden (Willie). In particular, with the help of Alice’s undisguised signal transmission, Bob can establish covert communications such that his transmission can be shielded from Willie. Considering both the non-retransmission protocol and the automatic repeat-request (ARQ) protocol for Bob’s transmission, we study the resource allocation design. By exploiting the channel statistics, the joint design of active beamforming at Alice and Bob, the passive beamforming at the IRS, and the packet length of the confidential data packet is formulated as a nonconvex optimization problem which minimizes the age of information (AoI) at Alice for the two considered protocols taking into account the quality of service in terms of the maximum tolerable AoI at Bob and communication covertness. To circumvent the non-convexity of the design problem, we propose alternating optimization algorithms to find effective solutions. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed optimization algorithms over various benchmarks and unveil the decrease of the optimized packet length with the improved covert channel quality.
