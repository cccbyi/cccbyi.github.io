From Sep/2013 to Jun/2016,I was pursuing my Ph.D. degree with the [School of Information and Communication Engineering](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/), Xi'an Jiaotong University, China.From Sep/2010 to Jul/2013, I obtained my Master of Engineering degree from the same university.Currently, I am working as an associate professor at Xidian University in Xi'an. 

My research is primarily centered on **Artificial intelligence inspired wireless communication design**, with a focus on **deep reinforcement learning and deep learning algorithms**. I'm also dedicated to exploring **wireless endogenetic security** and **Fluid antenna for future wireless communications**. If you are interested in our work, you can refer to this [website](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/chaowang/en/index.html).
If you have any questions or have an interest in collaborating with me, please feel free to email me (chaowang@xidian.edu.cn or drchaowang@126.com)!
